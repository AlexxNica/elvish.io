      <p>
        Text pipelines are intuitive and powerful. However, if your data have
        inherently complex structures, passing them through the pipeline
        often requires a lot of ad-hoc, hard-to-maintain text processing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pipelines in Elvish can carry structured data, not just text. You can
        stream lists, maps and even functions through the pipeline.

        If you know programming, you probably already know how

        Control structures in Elvish have an intuitive C-like syntax.
